# CHR-RAM MMC3

An 8bitworkshop NES example for implementing dynamic tiles with banks in C.

## Setup

Click the following link to use setup this project in the 8bitworkshop development environment. https://8bitworkshop.com/v3.5.0/?repo=geo-gs%2Fchr_ram_mmc3&platform=nes&file=chr_ram_example.c

## Why?

There didn't seem to be any explicit 8bitworkshop examples of how to store and swap multiple graphic sets in C. Additionally, there was only one example of how to store and load data from banks but that example did not use CHR-RAM. I also wanted a clear example of how to set up a project that would load multiple tilesets correctly in the 8bitworkshop asset editor.
